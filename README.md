These are bindings to the [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja) arm64
[architecture/disassembler plugin](https://github.com/Vector35/arch-arm64).

Note that while Binary Ninja is an (excellent) commercial product, the
disassembler is entirely Apache 2 licensed and may be used without a license.
To install, just add bad64 as a normal dependency in Cargo.toml.

For more information on how this disassembler was created, see [this blogpost][blogpost]
by [Andrew Lamoureux][andrew].
